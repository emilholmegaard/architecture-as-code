# Architecture Decision Records

## ADR-001: Hexagonal Architecture

### Status
Accepted

### Context
We need a flexible architecture that allows us to easily swap implementations and test business logic in isolation.

### Decision
We will use Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters) pattern.

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Clear separation of concerns, testability, flexibility
- **Negative**: Initial complexity, more boilerplate code

---

## ADR-002: ArchUnit for Architecture Testing

### Status
Accepted

### Context
We need to enforce architectural rules and prevent architecture erosion over time.

### Decision
Use ArchUnit to write executable architecture tests.

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Automated architecture validation, early detection of violations
- **Negative**: Learning curve for developers, maintenance of tests

## ADR-003: Fitness Functions for Quality Metrics

### Status
Accepted

### Context
We need continuous monitoring of architecture quality metrics.

### Decision
Implement fitness functions to measure modularity, coupling, cohesion, and complexity.

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Objective quality metrics, trend analysis, early warning system
- **Negative**: Additional test execution time, threshold calibration needed

---

## ADR-004: Event-Driven Communication

### Status
Accepted

### Context
Case handling system needs to react to various order events asynchronously.

### Decision
Use event-driven architecture for inter-service communication.

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Loose coupling, scalability, resilience
- **Negative**: Eventual consistency, debugging complexity

---

## ADR-005: Package Structure by Feature

### Status
Accepted

### Context
Need clear organization of code that reflects business capabilities.

### Decision
Organize packages by business feature within each architectural layer.

### Consequences
- **Positive**: High cohesion, clear boundaries, easier navigation
- **Negative**: Potential duplication, refactoring complexity
